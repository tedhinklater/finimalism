If you've updated to Jellyfin v10.11 you'll need the new version

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@latest/finimalism10.11.css");
```
or
```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@latest/finimalism10.11-black.css");

```

Just paste an import line into your "Dashboard > Branding > CSS" section, or "User Settings > Display > CSS" section.
