If you've updated to Jellyfin v10.11 you'll need the new version

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@latest/finimalism10.11.css");
```
or
```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@latest/finimalism10.11-black.css");

```

Just paste an import line into your "Dashboard > General > CSS" section, or "User Settings > Display > CSS" section.

Everything is just an alteration of the amazing work already put into [Ultrachromic by CTalvio](https://github.com/CTalvio/Ultrachromic).
